# Smart-Doorbell-and-Pet-Monitor
This project builds a professional smart doorbell and pet monitoring system using Linux kernel drivers for I2C and SPI hardware communication. The system detects motion at your front door, captures video, enables two-way audio communication via mobile app, and can differentiate between human visitors and pet activity.
